Loading and prepocessing the data

```{r}
activity <- read.table("repdata_data_activity/activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
## Total number of steps taken per day
sum(activity$steps)
## Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(activity$steps, main = "Total number of steps taken per day", xlab = "Steps")
## Mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
mean(activity$steps)
median(activity$steps)
```

What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
activity_AGG <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity, mean)
plot(activity_AGG$interval,activity_AGG$steps, type = "l", main = "Average number of steps taken x 5-minute interval", ylab = "Average Number of Steps", xlab = "5-min interval")
```

Imputing missing values
```{r}
table(is.na(activity))
activity[is.na(activity$steps),]$steps <- mean(activity$steps,na.rm = TRUE)
activity_new <- activity
hist(activity_new$steps, main = "Total number of steps taken per day", xlab = "Steps")
mean(activity_new$steps)
median(activity_new$steps)
sum(activity_new$steps)
```

Are there dufferences in activity between weekdays and weekends?
```{r}
weekday <- c("segunda-feira", "terÃ§a-feira", "quarta-feira", "quinta-feira", "sexta-feira")
activity_new$day <- factor(weekdays(activity_new$date) %in% weekday, levels = c(FALSE, TRUE), labels = c("weekend", "weekday"))

activity_new_AGG <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, activity_new, mean)
library(lattice)
xyplot(activity_new_AGG$steps ~ activity_new_AGG$interval | activity_new_AGG$day, type = "l", main = "Average number of steps taken x 5-minute interval", ylab = "Average Number of Steps", xlab = "5-min interval")
```
